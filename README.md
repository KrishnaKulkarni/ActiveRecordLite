ActiveRecordLite
================

A clone of the basic ActiveRecord ORM functionality. I used extensive 
metaprogramming to enable mass assignment, associatons, and querying. 

Metaprogramming was a big challenge as it challenged me to rethink the nature of Classes and the relationship 
between instances and classes and to learn a lot more about what principles generalized in Object-Oriented Programming
and how that played out in a Ruby context.
